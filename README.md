  I developed an Ado.Net project in C# using Visual Studio and used SQL Server's Express version as the database. First, I created my database and entered my data into a table. I opened a grid for my table from the form screen. I defined two classes: one called "ProductDal" for performing database operations, and the other, "Product," for my products. I established my database connection and utilized lists and a While loop. I wrote methods in my database operations class for adding, deleting, and updating data, and used these methods by assigning events to my buttons
